# hello-world 

Hi guys from GitHub!
This my first repository (Actually it'snt, it's my thirst repository but whatever...). 
I'm not virgin about programming 'cause I started learn programming at the beginning of last year.
Until now, I have learned the basic and a little bit more than the basic about C, C++, Java and Visual Basic.
